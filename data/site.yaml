  #   Designer, developer, and entrepreneur. 

  #   I'm originally from Paris, France but these days I live in Osaka, Japan. 
    
  #   After studying computer science and teaching myself UI design, 
  #   I now spend my time working on personal projects, 
  #   contributing to open source, and writing.

    A little more about me.
  items: 
    - description: >

        I've always loved spending way too much time on the computer, 
        and spent my teens tinkering with Photoshop and building crappy websites.
        
        But after getting a computer science degree, I realized writing compilers wasn't for me
        and decided to switch majors completely and learn Mandarin instead. 
        
        Yet as it turns out, my path would lead back to computers: after moving to China in 2006, I ended up quitting my language studies and getting a job in Beijing as a web designer.

        After coming back to France in 2007, I became a freelance UI designer, working with companies such as
        [Hipmunk](https://www.hipmunk.com/), [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/), and [Le Monde](http://www.lemonde.fr/).
       
        A few years later, I decided what I really wanted was to create my own products, and 
        set out to re-learn web programming. 
        
        After moving to Japan in 2012 for my wife's studies, I'm now living my dream of writing, working on my own projects, and
        trying to make a living as a solo entrepreneur.

      description: >
        I learned the [Meteor](http://meteor.com) JavaScript framework to build Telescope, 
        and decided to reinvest the knowledge I had just acquired to co-author
        a book together with [Tom Coleman](https://github.com/tmeasday).

        I got tired of all this talk of “JavaScript fatigue”, so I 
        created a survey to get more data about recent trends in the 
        JavaScript community.
