    I'm a designer, developer, and entrepreneur 
    originally from Paris, France but now living in Osaka, Japan. 
    After studying computer science and then becoming a freelance UI designer, 
    I now spend my time working on personal projects, 
    contributing to open source, and writing.

      description: >
        I learned the [Meteor](http://meteor.com) JavaScript framework to build Telescope, 
        and decided to reinvest the knowledge I had just acquired to co-author
        a book together with [Tom Coleman](https://github.com/tmeasday).

        I first got the idea for a design community all the way back in 2012,
        and that ended up becoming Sidebar.
